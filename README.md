A respository holding all of the small tools I've made.

Listing
=========

Delta
-------
Written in Java. Given a txt file with a list of items, Delta will choose one for you using a PRNG. Each item is denoted with a '>>' or a '<<'. When choosing, Delta will ignore all items prefixed with '<<'. This is useful if you don't want any item to be chosen more than once. Originally written to decrease the embarassing amount of time my indecisive roommate and I spent deciding what to do.


plc
---
Written in Python. Given one or more directories as input, it will find all audio files and create Media Player Classic playlists for each directory.

namestrip
---------
Written in Python. Given a directory it batch renames files based on a given criteria. For instance, providing "alpha" as criteria will rename files to only contain alpha characters.
Originally written because I wanted to remove the Chinese characters from a few hundred audio files.
